##  bandwidth

note:
    I have content to publish, say my first collection of Modernist Poetry, I stick it on a webserver. My mum reads it, no problem.
    I publish a poem about the Turkish Prime Minister and a goat, suddenly it get popular, a million people access it. I have to pay the bandwidth costs of a million downloads.
    Given those costs I am likely to outsource hosting to someone else.
    The protocol is destiny.
